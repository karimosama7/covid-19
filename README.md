🚀 COVID-19 Data Analysis: Insights from Poland

I recently completed a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data focusing on Poland, utilizing Python and key data science libraries. Here’s a snapshot of what I explored:


🔍 Data Exploration:



Investigated a rich dataset of COVID-19 statistics from various countries, filtering specifically for Poland.

Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values.

📊 Key Insights:



Analyzed trends over time by aggregating metrics like total cases, new cases, deaths, and tests.

Visualized data distributions with density plots and explored relationships between critical variables through scatter plots and time series graphs.

🌍 Visualizations & Findings:



Created impactful visualizations including line plots for case and death trends, scatter plots for case relationships, and pie charts showcasing the distribution of total cases, tests, deaths, and vaccinations.

Generated a heatmap of correlations to understand the interplay between different metrics.

🔬 Tools & Techniques:



Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for analysis and visualization.

Implemented data aggregation, trend analysis, and correlation analysis to derive actionable insights.

This project provided valuable perspectives on the progression of COVID-19 in Poland and demonstrated the power of data visualization in uncovering trends and patterns.
